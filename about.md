As a recovering lurker, I have come to appreciate the thoughts and ideas that emerge from personal blogs and online communities. I love to read, and I hate to comment.

But no one lives on an island, and no developer starts anything completely from scratch. We all rely on the internet and each other to build better and better things.

Sometimes I sit at my terminal, and I ponder:

So simple! So profound! I have a masters in Computer Science, two B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in Women's Studies. I graduated from Iowa State University in 2016 and Regis University in May of 2013. Currently I work as a software developer at Kingland Systems, where I use cognitive computing techniques to solve our data related problems. Within the past year or so I have applied Natural Language Processing, classifiers and bio-informatics algorithms in the cloud to scrape mutual fund prospectus data. 

I love new opportunities, whether they come in the form of research, hobbies or otherwise. Take it from a recovering lurkerFeel free to contact me
